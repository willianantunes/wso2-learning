===========

It has all the tests I did and the ones which I've been doing using the following courses, materials and helpers:

- [WSO2 ESB Developer Fundamentals](http://wso2.com/training/enterprise-service-bus-developer-fundamentals) | [Lab Kit](https://github.com/wso2/WSO2-Training/releases/tag/ESB4.8.xDF)
- [WSO2 ESB Administration](https://github.com/wso2/WSO2-Training/releases/tag/ESB4.8.xA)
- [Official WSO2 YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMnlRiQLlrPn6-Jg7nvfD4w)
- [Mailing list](http://wso2.com/mail/)
- [Product documentation](https://docs.wso2.com/)

## Requirements

It requires the following:

- [WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus](http://wso2.com/products/enterprise-service-bus/#download)
- [WSO2 Application Server](http://wso2.com/products/application-server/#download)
- [WSO2 Developer Studio](http://wso2.com/products/developer-studio/#download). It's possible to configure everything from the ESB dashboard, but for the sake of the easiness I recommend this tool.
